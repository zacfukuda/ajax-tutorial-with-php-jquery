In this tutorial, you will send texts to the server and recieve the message along with http status code. After recieving, you will display that message on the current page.
For usability, you will also add a proper class to the message box according to the status code you recieve from the server.

Since this tutorial requires you to excute PHP, you need to run the web server. If you are using PHP 5.4 or higher, simply you can run the local web server by,

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Please make sure that you are at the application root on the terminal and you are not running the localhost:8000 in the other service, such as MAMP, WAMP, or Vagrant.

In the index.html, the path is written in relatively, so it doesn't matter if you put the codes in the lower level.
